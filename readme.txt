This is a Tic-Tac-Toe app.

This project was made using objects, constructors and modules.
It took quite some time to build, expeccialy the AI part.

Version1:
- created UI
- edited CSS, made it look 'nice'
- added 'choose color' buttons and 'restart' button
- wrote functions that create players - 2 players, person and CPU
- wrote function that clicks on random available field
- disabled occupied fields
- version 1 took about 4 hours to finish

Version 2:
- Improved UI a bit, added CSS animations, animated Xs and Os
- added functions that play the game - enabled computer to play 
  random fields
- added logic that checks for the winner - RegEx that is tested
  against the data-number attribute of the 'clicked' fields. If
  the numbers match the regex, the winner is returned.
- added logic that checks for the draw
- added functionality to 'restart' button
- for now, the 'win or draw' status can be seen in the console
- version 2 took about 4 hours to finish

Version 3:
- added display to show the win/draw status and buttons to restart
- added transitions and box shadows in CSS
- version 3 took about 2 hours to finish

Version 4:
- this was the hardest part of the project, implemented the AI to
  make the game unbeatable
- created 3 difficulties, easy medium and hard.
- player can now choose difficulty and 'color'
- 'medium' difficulty means 50% chance for random field and 50% 
  chance for unbeatable logic.
